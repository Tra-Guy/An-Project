# An-Project
This is just an Command prompt application.
Basic idea of that program will be that we can create an basic user id in which specif object in form of anything including text can be saved and be uploaded or downloaded
I create a server in which information will be saved
Stuff about that program:
1) An interface in which people can create an unique id and password and save that in server as an object.
2) It can store anything with a heading like - MyVar , Details etc
3) it can be uploaded or downloaded from server
4) Even if we dont have access to the main id or account, we will have an unique code by which we can access that object.
There are specific chance that later it will be converted to website. But for now i dont have any idea for any website for this idea
AND language will be c# for that program
